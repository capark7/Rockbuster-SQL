# Rockbuster-SQL

### SUMMARY
A data analysis project using PostgreSQL to analyze data from a fictional movie rental company, Rockbuster Stealth that is planning to launch an online video rental store.

### OBJECTIVES
* Load and clean data.

* Document the relationships between tables, columns, and keys in a data dictionary and an entity relationship diagram.

* Query the database to answer questions from marketing and sales teams.

* Highlight key results to executive team as well as document all work for the rest of the data department.

### DATA
Fictitious data available [here](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip)

The dataset is comprised of multiple tables. Descriptions and Entity Relationship Diagram can be found in the Rockbuster Data Dictionary.

### TOOLS
*Language:* PostgreSQL

*Software:* pgAdmin, DbVisualizer, Tableau, Excel

### SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
* **Cleaning data:** Checked and addressed duplicates, non-uniform data, and missing values.

* **Joining tables:** Selected the type of joins and sequence of joins in order to minimize the time/memory needed.

* **Writing queries:** Explored basic descriptive statistics (max/min, mean or mode) for variables and used GROUP BY and ORDER BY to answer more complicated questions from executives. 

* **Coding with Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Designed CTEs that would make code more readable and easier to reuse.

* **Reporting results:** Customized the reports to suit the audience. Executives received a Powerpoint presentation with answers to key questions and recommendations. In addition to this, a data dictionary and an Excel workbook were created for other data analysts to view my queries and results.
